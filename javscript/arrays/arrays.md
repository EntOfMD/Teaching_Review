# Arrays

### An array can hold multiple values within a single variable. This means that you can contain a list of values within an array and iterate through them.

### Each item or value that is inside of an array is called an element. You can refer to the elements of an array by using an index number.

### Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, arrays are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].
#
#### An array of strings, for example, looks like this:
```javascript
let fish = ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel"];
```

#### - If we call the variable fish, weâ€™ll receive the following output:
```javascript
console.log(fish);

$> ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel"];
```

#### Arrays are a very flexible data type because they are mutable in that they can have element values added, removed, and changed.
